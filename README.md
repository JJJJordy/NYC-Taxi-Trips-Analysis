This project analyzes **NYC Taxi Trips data** to uncover insights into transportation demand, trip patterns, and revenue distribution across New York City.  
The dataset contains millions of rows of trips recorded by the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC).

## 🎯 Guiding Question
**How do NYC taxi trips vary by time, distance, passenger count, and location — and what does this tell us about transportation demand patterns?**

---

## 🔍 Sub-questions
1. **Trip Demand Over Time**
   - What are the busiest hours of the day?  
   - How do weekdays differ from weekends?  

2. **Trip Characteristics**
   - What’s the average trip distance and duration?  
   - How do fares relate to distance and time?  

3. **Geographic Insights**
   - What are the most common pickup and dropoff zones?  
   - Where are the main demand hotspots in NYC?  

4. **Revenue & Passenger Trends**
   - How does revenue vary by hour, day, and month?  
   - How many passengers per trip (solo vs group travel)?
